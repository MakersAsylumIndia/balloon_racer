balloon racer car - laser cut cardboard, skewers, bendy straw, balloon and elastic bands / sticky tape

* Laser cut the body from 2 mm thick cardboard, making sure the flutes are aligned along the length of the car body.
* RED indicates CUTTING, and BLUE indicates scoring lines to help with folding.
* Fold and form the body, locking it all together using the locking tabs.
* There are two retaining flaps along the central ridge to help retain the bendy straw in place. You may need to pre-fold them before the first step.
* Insert the front and rear axles. Each is 140 mm long, cut from a 3mm diameter skewer.
* Insert the small cardboard washer / spacer pieces that help retain the axles in place.
* Build the wheels. Each wheel is made up of six layers. Rotate each layer by 60 deg so that the flutes are evenly distributed. Use 12mm long bits of skewer pieces to hold the 6 layers together.
* Add the small cardboard washer / spacer on each axle to lock the wheels in place. This may not be necessary if the wheels are already a tight fit on the axles.
